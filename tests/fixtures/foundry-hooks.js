/**
 * Foundry's Hooks as the system meets them (V11 to V13), for the tests of the hooks a module subscribes to: `on` and
 * `once` record `{hook, id, fn, once}` in `events[hook]`, in order; `callAll` calls each one and CATCHES its error
 * without throwing it again (Foundry logs it through Hooks.onError), so a test that went through callAll would keep
 * what a failing subscriber wrote (relecture du 21/10, D1). `seen` lists the hooks whose subscribers were called.
