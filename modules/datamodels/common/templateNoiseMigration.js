/**
 * The matrix noise a template puts on the actors inside it.
 *
 * A spam or static zone adds its rating to the Noise (SR5 p. 232). Before d7b64aa66 (N32,
 * 2026-10-04) the template effect stored -rating, so every device inside it rolled more dice.
 * The effect is created once, when the token enters the template, and kept as long as it stays:
 * a world played before the fix kept the old negative value until the template was placed again.
 *
 * A template's noise is the sum of its Spam and Static ratings, never negative: a negative noise
 * on an area effect can only come from the old code, and is turned back into the rating.
 * Arbitrage de DjamZ (2026-10-06, T6) : migrer les gabarits existants.
 *
 * Called from `Item.migrateData`, so it covers every item wherever it is, unlinked tokens included.
 * @param {object} source  The raw data of an item.
 * @return {object}        The same source object.
