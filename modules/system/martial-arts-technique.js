//dialog chooses that shot: they always apply. So does a situational effect, which only becomes a box of the
//roll dialog (All-Out Attack, Balestra, Run & Gun p. 134: the action is chosen there). Any other effect (a pool,
//a defense) applies on its own for a permanent technique; for a technique that is an action, it waits for the switch.
//The called shots any item can ease (G14) are read the same way, when the roll dialog chooses the shot
