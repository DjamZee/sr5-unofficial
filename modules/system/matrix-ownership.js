//   that asks for four marks (Change Icon, Invite Mark, Switch Interface Mode, Trackback…) is the owner's alone, since
//   nobody else can place more than three.
// - The owner the system knows: a persona owns itself and the devices it carries; a drone, an agent or a sprite is
//   owned by the one who deployed, ran or compiled it (system.creatorId); a device slaved to an actor's PAN by that
//   actor. A host, its IC and the devices slaved to it belong to the host's owner, which the system does not record.
// - KC p. 51: the security spiders count as owners of the system, and command any device of it without a mark. The
//   system knows no spider: it asks the modules (hook sr5.matrixAdministrator, the module Matrice names them).
// - A hand-made device with no master, a drone with no creator: the owner cannot be told. Nothing is refused then,
//   the gamemaster is told (Élise, lot 19: no false alarm in honest play).
