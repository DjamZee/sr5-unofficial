//   an image or a file, to a user whose commcode the character knows; through a DNI, even in AR, about a paragraph.
//   The same action opens a live feed (a call) to one or more users.
// - SR5 p. 241, Snoop (GE + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Logic + Firewall, 1 mark): the hacker intercepts the traffic sent
//   from or to the target as long as she keeps a mark on it; the sidebar: in a call, she notes the correspondent and
//   may look for him with a Matrix Perception (SR5 p. 242).
// - SR5 p. 246, Trace Icon (2 marks): the physical location of the target, known as long as one mark stays.
// - SR5 p. 424: a device whose wireless is off is out of the Matrix; SR5 p. 443: a jammer "bloque les communications
//   sans fil"; SR5 p. 232: a Faraday cage leaves no signal (not drawn by the system).
// - Kill Code p. 43, Haywire: "il est impossible de passer des appels" (the system does not keep that state: the
//   gamemaster plays it).
// The book does not say what becomes of a message sent to a device out of reach: it waits for the device and is
// delivered when it comes back (a call is not: nobody answers). A choice of the author, said in the wiki.
