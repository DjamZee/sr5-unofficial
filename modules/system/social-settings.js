// Cutting Aces social rules (lot 21): one world setting for what the roll dialog offers, the social maneuvers
// (p. 153: "les MJ peuvent choisir lesquelles autoriser dans leur partie") and the con steps (p. 162-164).
// Ticked by default: both are only offered, never applied unless chosen, and the book gives them as options of
// the game. Unticked, the dialog keeps the system's social tests as they were; the effects already carried
// by an earlier maneuver are still offered, and the con tracker stays open to the gamemaster.
