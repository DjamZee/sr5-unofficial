// "The jammer generates Noise equal to its Device Rating. An area jammer affects a spherical area, and its rating
// is reduced by 1 every 5 meters (similar to grenades). A directional jammer affects a 30-degree cone, and its
// rating is reduced by 1 every 20 meters. A jammer affects all devices (and personas on those devices) in the area."
// The wireless bonus lets it spare designated devices and personas. A cranial jammer works the same way, but its
// effects are limited to the person it is attached to.
//
// The page leaves three things open, settled by DjamZ on 2026-10-04 (gaps in the book, not rules of the table):
// - the rating drops at every full step, so a target standing exactly 5 m (or 20 m) away already gets 1 less;
// - several jammers on one target add up, each one keeping its own effect (as the Jam Signals action already does);
// - the directional cone stays where it was aimed when the jammer was turned on, it does not follow the token.
// Walls are left to the gamemaster by the page itself, and are not coded.
