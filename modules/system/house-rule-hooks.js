/**
 * The hooks through which a module of house rules (Câblage Maison, lot 2, 21/10) changes what the system does, on the
 * pattern of sr5.essenceCostFor (implant-essence.js): the system plays the book; a world whose house rule changes it
 * says so in a module, never in the system. Each hook hands its subscribers a data object to set; a value that is not
 * of the kind asked, or a subscriber that throws, leaves the book's. Without a module, no subscriber: the book.
 *
 * The subscribers are called one by one here (callSubscribers), never through Hooks.callAll: Foundry's callAll catches
 * a subscriber's error without throwing it again, so what it wrote before failing would be kept (relecture du 21/10, D1:
 * an Essence of 0.1 instead of 2, a sale at 1 ¥, a purchase on credit let through). Here, a subscriber that throws has
 * its answer thrown away, the others' kept: alone, the book.
 *
 * - sr5.rollReminders (information): lines shown in the roll dialog, each with an "applies" box left unticked, and on
 *   the card. A line may carry dice, added to the pool only when the box is ticked.
 * - sr5.vendorPrice (verdict): the unit price a vendor asks of a buyer, after the book's (surcharge, dealer).
 * - sr5.purchaseFunds (verdict): a purchase the buyer's accounts cannot pay, let through or refused (the book: refused).
 * - sr5.vendorRefusal (verdict): a vendor that will not sell to a buyer, with the reason shown (the book: it sells).
 * - sr5.initiativeReminders (information and score): lines written on the Initiative card, each with an Initiative
 *   score modifier applied at once (there is no dialog to tick it in).
 * - sr5.situationalArmor (score): Armor a module adds against one attack (a kinetic field against bullets), at the
 *   damage resistance test, before the AP and the conversion to Stun.
