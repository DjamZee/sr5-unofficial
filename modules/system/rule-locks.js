/**
 * Rule locks (B13, "light automation"): where the system refuses an action in the name of a book rule,
 * the gamemaster may lift the refusal for a whole family of rules. The roll, the counters and the
 * computations stay as they are; only the "no" goes, and it becomes a whisper to the gamemaster.
 *
 * Lot 0 holds the shared function and the settings: no refusal site reads it yet. A site keeps its own
 * test and swaps its exit, `if (cond) return ui.notifications.warn(…)` becoming
 * `if (cond && refuseByRule("ammo", "SR5.WARN_…", data, { actor })) return`.
 *
 * Settings (world, hidden, edited from the "Rule locks" tab of the settings window):
 * - sr5RuleLocks: one box per family, and the two boxes of the "objects" family that were settings of their own;
 * - sr5RuleLocksPreset: "book", "light" or "custom", what the boxes amount to;
 * - sr5RuleLocksMigration: 1 once the three former settings were copied in, 2 once sr5BlockMissingActions moved to its box (runRuleLocksMigration).
 * - sr5RuleLocksAsk: "pending" in a new world until its gamemaster chose a preset, then "done"; "" in any other world.
 * The default is the book: every box checked.
