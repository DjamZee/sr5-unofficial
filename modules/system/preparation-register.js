// The gamemaster's register of a preparation's start and pace (SR5 p. 309, decision G9): when it was made, its
// starting Potency, how long it keeps it full and how fast it loses it. A world setting, which only a gamemaster may
// write, kept by the active GM through the ledger queue (gm-ledger.js).
//
// A player's client refuses to change these fields (hooks/item.js, stripGMOnlyChanges), but a client can be made to
// skip its own checks. So the active GM, who sees every write through the hooks, checks again: a value a player
// changed is put back from the register, and he is told (Victoire's review). A preparation a player makes is read
// against the GM's clock and the book's defaults. Nothing is checked while no gamemaster is connected; at the next
// GM's arrival, what does not match the register is put back. At its first round the register takes the
// preparations made before it as they stand; after that, an unknown one (made while no gamemaster was connected) is
// brought back to the book's reading, and the gamemaster is told (boundedUnknown).
