 * sight, ultrasound having then nothing left to reveal (SR5 p. 449).
 * @param {Set<string>} statuses  The set to fill, cleared first
 * @param {Iterable} effects      The effects that apply to the actor
 * @returns {Set<string>}

 * Make actor.statuses read the effects at the moment it is asked, instead of when the actor is prepared.
 * Filling it in prepareData was not enough : the synthetic actor of an unlinked token is prepared before
 * the effects of its delta are attached, and after a reload its statuses stayed empty although the effect
 * was there (an invisible grunt seen by all, a dead one no longer defeated).
