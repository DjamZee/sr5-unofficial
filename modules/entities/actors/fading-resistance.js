/**
 * The hook through which a module names the attribute a technomancer resists Fading with, besides Resonance.
 * The book's is Willpower (SR5 p. 254); a world whose house rule changes it (the streams of a fan supplement,
 * Charisma or Logic) says so in a module, never in the system.
 * Called with `{actor, persona, attribute}`: `persona` "resonance" (a living persona) or "nanite" (a head case),
 * `attribute` "willpower". A subscriber sets `attribute` to a key of SR5.characterAttributes; any other value leaves
 * Willpower; a subscriber that throws has its answer thrown away (the others' kept). Without a module, no subscriber:
 * Willpower.
