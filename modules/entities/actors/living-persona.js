// SR5 p. 236: a technomancer's living persona is bound to no device; it exists in the Matrix as long as she is awake,
// unless she unplugs on purpose. SR5 p. 253: its Device Rating is her Resonance, its attributes come from her mental
// attributes, it runs no program, and it is no device: neither master nor slave of a network, part of no PAN or WAN.
// Kill Code p. 107, quality "Fusion avec la matrice": 2 Karma, the persona may be a slave of a deck or a commlink;
// 8 Karma, it may be the master of a PAN of Resonance x 3 slaves; 10 Karma, both.
//
// The persona stays an itemDevice of type livingPersona, so that the marks put on it, the cards that aim at it
// (target.itemUuid), its defense and its resistance keep working as they did. What the system adds:
// - every technomancer (activeSpecialAttribute "resonance") has one, created by the active gamemaster alone when it
//   is missing (Rosalie's technomancer with no persona, 07/10), and marked system.managed;
// - a managed persona cannot be deleted while its actor is a technomancer, nor turned into another kind of device;
// - which device is in use stays the player's choice: a technomancer who connects through a commlink to hide what
//   she is (SR5 p. 253, Data Trails p. 63) keeps that choice, and the persona is created switched off beside it.
// The rules below have no Foundry in them, so that tests can read them.
