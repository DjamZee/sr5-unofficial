// What an observer sees of a crown, as plain rules with no Foundry in them so that tests can read them (couronne du
// PAN, lot 1). The book, SR5 p. 236-238:
// - the devices that do not run silent within 100 meters are spotted at once, measured from the antenna (the
//   commlink or the deck); farther away, it takes a Matrix Perception (p. 236);
// - an icon one has marked is spotted without a test, at any distance (p. 236), and its owner always sees it (p. 238);
// - a spotted icon stays spotted even when it goes silent; a silent one is found by Matrix Perception (p. 236-237);
// - there is no physical distance for a host (p. 236);
// - a device whose wireless is off is not in the Matrix.
// The rulings of DjamZ (07/10, CAHIER-COURONNE-PAN.md):
// - Q2: without a commlink or a deck switched on, one only sees one's own crown (the gamemaster may reveal);
// - Q3: the observer is the token one controls, otherwise one's assigned character;
// - Q4: a device the gamemaster reveals is revealed to the whole table; or, with the world setting "player by player"
//   (idea 10, lot 16b), to the characters he ticked (revealedTo);
// - with the world setting "the gamemaster decides" (lot 3), a player only sees her own crown and what the gamemaster
//   revealed: no spotting, no mark, no range.
// Nothing here is hardened against the console (decision of 06/10): every client works out its own view, a comfort
// of play and no secret.
