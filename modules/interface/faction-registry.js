 *   log: [{id, factionId, actorId, reason, delta, pending, time, note}], raises: {contactUuid: worldTime}};
 * - canWrite: true on the active gamemaster's browser only;
 * - faction(id), factionOfActor(actorId), factionOfContact(itemUuid): a copy of the faction, or null;
 * - score(factionId, actorId): the applied movements' sum; standing(actorId): [{id, name, score, shift, pending}];
 * - attitudeFor(actorId, targetActor): {faction, score, shift, attitude} of a social test (CA p. 160), or null;
 * - update(mutate): the active gamemaster only (false, with a warning, elsewhere), in the registry's turn
 *   (gm-ledger.js). `mutate(data)` changes `data` in place, synchronously (an async one writes nothing). After it, one
 *   main faction per member and per contact (CA p. 156): a member listed in two factions stays in the one it just
 *   joined. The system does not check the rest: unique ids, a known faction in `enemies`, a reciprocal enmity are
 *   the module's to keep. Example, affiliate an NPC:
 *   update(d => d.factions.find(f => f.id === id).members.push(actorId)) — it leaves its former faction.
 * `members` is the MAIN faction, never a list of allegiances: an actor is in the members of one faction at most
 * (CA p. 156, an NPC "generally" has one faction; kept as is on purpose, 22/10). A secondary tie (a mole, a
 * double agent, an old crew) is the module's to note elsewhere (its own data, the faction's note), not in `members`:
 * a second push moves the actor, it does not add a faction.
 * Every read gives a copy, so a module never edits the setting's cache.
