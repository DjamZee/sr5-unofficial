/**
 * The trace a purchase leaves (lot 12): one id shared by the debit and every
 * piece it paid for, with who bought, where, when and for how much. The shop,
 * a vendor's counter and an order delivered later all write it the same way,
 * in play as in creation, so the Concepteur's refund and the gamemaster's
 * summary read the purchase from the pieces themselves instead of matching
 * creation times (review 153: a vehicle's mods and their debit are two writes).
 *
 * flags.sr5.purchase = {
 *   id,          shared by the debit and the pieces
 *   buyer,       the actor who paid
 *   recipient,   the vehicle or drone the pieces went aboard, or null
 *   user,        the user who bought
 *   place,       'shop', 'vendor', 'creation' or 'equip'
 *   vendor,      the vendor's shop name, or null
 *   date,        real date and time (ISO)
 *   worldTime,   game time
 *   price,       what this document stands for: a piece's share, the debit's total
