/**
 * Repairing the Negotiation lost before the key fix (Hugo's review, Élise's brief).
 *
 * An actor or a contact imported while the skill was still stored under the
 * former key `negociation` lost it for good: the data model dropped the key at
 * creation and wrote Negotiation 0. migrateData cannot bring it back, and a 0
 * typed on purpose looks the same as a lost one. So nothing is repaired by
 * itself: the gamemaster is shown the candidates, whose compendium source still
 * gives a Negotiation above 0, and ticks what applies.
 *
 * Pure: the tests read it as it is.
