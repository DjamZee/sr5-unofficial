/**
 * The radius of an area spell as cast, in metres.
 * - An area spell: its Force in metres.
 * - A detection spell: Force × Magic of the caster, × 10 at extended range (SR5, Detection spells).
 * - Spell Shaping adds 1 m of radius per die given up (SR5 p. 329): added to the radius above, never multiplied.
 * The bubbles of Spell Shaping are not handled here: see spell-shaping.js (a world setting).
 * Kept free of Foundry globals so the rule can be read, and tested, alone.
