/**
 * Picking a pocket (SR5 p. 135, p. 422).
 *
 * The core book has no rule of its own for it: SR5 p. 135 gives Palming the
 * lifting of small objects (specialization Pickpocket) and p. 422 the opposed
 * test of a concealed object, Palming + Agility [Physical] against
 * Perception + Intuition [Mental], the object's concealability added to the
 * observer's pool. The observer notices on a tie.
 *
 * What the book leaves open was ruled by DjamZ (2026-10-05): small objects
 * only, the GM can pass over; a glitch takes the object but the target feels
 * something without knowing who; a critical glitch is caught red-handed; a
 * Complex Action in combat.
 *
 * Kept free of Foundry globals so the rules can be read, and tested, alone.
 * The "plant" mode (putting an object on someone) is the same test the other
 * way round: only `transferEnds` knows the direction, so a second batch plugs
 * in there.
